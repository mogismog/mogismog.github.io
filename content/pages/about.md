I probably ought to fill this in with more detail, but here's the gist of it:

- Got my Ph.D in Meteorology in 2014
- Worked at The Climate Corporation on spatiotemporal models related to precipitation estimation, and later distributed machine learning solutions.
- I now work at Convoy on pricing models, utilizing both time series approaches (e.g. structural time series) and traditional ML/deep learning solutions.
